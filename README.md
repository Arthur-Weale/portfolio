# Overview

For this project, I created a personal portfolio website to strengthen my skills as a software developer and improve my ability to build real-world web applications. The portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and experience through sections like Home, About, Projects, and Contact. It includes interactive project cards with links to GitHub repositories and live demos, as well as responsive design so the site works smoothly on phones, tablets, and desktops.

My purpose in building this software was to practice front-end development, learn how to structure and design a full website, and create a platform I can use to present my work to others. This project also helped me get comfortable with deploying web apps.
