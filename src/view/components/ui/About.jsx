              I’m a developer who genuinely enjoys building things that actually
              work and feel good to use. I like creating scalable, meaningful
              applications across web, backend, and cross-platform development,
              and I’m happiest when ideas slowly turn into real products. I care
              about balancing clean, thoughtful design with solid engineering,
              without taking myself too seriously in the process.

              My journey began with Python, but curiosity pulled me toward
              full-stack JavaScript pretty quickly. These days I enjoy working
              with React, TypeScript, and Next.js to build modern, responsive
              apps, and Node.js with PostgreSQL or MongoDB for dependable
              backends. I’m also exploring C# and .NET, learning data
              structures, algorithms, and experimenting with cross-platform
              tools like .NET MAUI and React Native because I like understanding
              how things work everywhere.

              Outside of code, I’m a foodie who dreams of a comfortable,
              enjoyable lifestyle and probably thinks about food more than
              necessary. I love video games, I’m fascinated by 3D printing and
              RC toys, and I still haven’t owned a PlayStation, which feels like
              a personal flaw I plan to fix. God of War is my favorite game, and
              waiting for GTA 6 has somehow become part of my personality. I’ve
              never tasted real coffee, and I dream of one day moving to the UK, USA,
              Switzerland, Australia, or New Zealand someday.
