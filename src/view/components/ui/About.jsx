              I’m a developer passionate about building scalable, impactful
              applications across web, backend, and cross-platform development.
              I enjoy turning ideas into products that balance thoughtful design
              with solid engineering.

              My journey began with Python, but I gravitated toward full-stack
              JavaScript. I use React, TypeScript, and Next.js to build modern,
              responsive apps, and Node.js with PostgreSQL or MongoDB for
              reliable backends. I’m also expanding into C# and .NET, exploring
              data structures, algorithms, and cross-platform frameworks like
              .NET MAUI and React Native.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m growing my skills in cloud (AWS, Azure) and DevOps practices
              to deliver software end-to-end. My goal is to become a
              well-rounded engineer who can create web, mobile, and desktop
              solutions while leveraging modern cloud and CI/CD tools. Outside
              of coding, I love learning new technologies and finding creative
              ways to solve problems.
